<!--HTML <meta> tag lets us specify metadata, which is additional important information about a document, in a variety of ways. The META elements can be used to include name/value pairs describing properties of the HTML document, such as author, expiry date, 
a list of keywords, document author etc-->


<!--HTML <meta> tag can be used to provide extra information. 
    It's a self-closing element, meaning it doesn't require a closing tag but carries information within its attributes. You can include one or more meta tags in your document based on what information you want to keep in your document but in general, meta tags do not impact
    the physical appearance of the document so from the appearance point
     of view, it does not matter if you include them or not.-->
