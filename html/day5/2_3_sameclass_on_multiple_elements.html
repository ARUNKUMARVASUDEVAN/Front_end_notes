       To create a class, you need to define it within
       your HTML document or link to an external CSS 
       file that contains class definitions. Classes 
       are defined using the "class" attribute.

       HTML classes are essential for styling and formatting
       web page elements consistently. They allow you to apply
       the same styles to multiple elements without repeating 
       code, promoting maintainability and a cohesive design.
