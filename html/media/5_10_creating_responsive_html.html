<!--
There are several ways by which we can make our webpage responsive. A general practice is to make use of inbuilt CSS or bootstrap frameworks that provide pre-designed components and grid systems. Here are some general steps to ensure responsiveness of a webpage.

Use Responsive Grid Layouts

Always design your layout with a flexible grid structure, so when the size of screen increases grid will extend accordingly.

Flexible Images and Media

Ensure that the images in webpage as properly scaled within their containers. You can use CSS properties like "max-width: 100%;" and "height: auto;".

Use Media Query

You can use CSS media queries to apply different styles for different screen sizes. This allows you to adjust the layout, font sizes, and other design elements based on the device's width. You can know about media query here.

Include Meta Tag with viewport

The viewport meta tag inside HTML head to ensures proper scaling and rendering on mobile devices.

Use Relative Units

Use relative units like em, rem, or percentages for font sizes, padding, and margins to ensure that text scales appropriately.
