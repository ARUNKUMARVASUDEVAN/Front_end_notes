<!--
Error handling in JavaScript is a process to detect and handle errors that occurs during the execution of a program.
Errors can be a syntax, runtime or logical errors. An error occurred during the execution of the program is called a runtime error or an exception.

What is an Error?
An error is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that prevents it from continuing normally.
Errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors.


Syntax Errors
Syntax errors, also called parsing errors, occur at compile time in traditional programming languages and at interpret time in JavaScript.

<script>
   window.print();
</script>


---------------------------------

Runtime Errors (Exceptions)

Runtime errors, also called exceptions, occur during execution (after compilation/interpretation).

<script>
   window.printme();
</script>

Exceptions in JS

ReferenceError − Trying to access an undefined variable/ method.

TypeError − Attempting an operation on incompatible data types.

RangeError − A value exceeds the allowed range.

-----------------------------------
Logical Errors

Logic errors can be the most difficult type of errors to track down. 
These errors are not the result of a syntax or runtime error. Instead, they occur when you make a mistake in the logic that drives your script and do not get the expected result

<script>
   let num = 10/0;
</script>

What is Error Handling?

Whenever any error occurs in the JavaScript code, the JavaScript engine stops the execution of the whole code.
If you handle such errors in the proper way, you can skip the code with errors and continue to execute the other JavaScript code.

try...catch...finally statements

throw statements

the onerror() event handler property

<!--------------------------
   try...catch...finally 

   <script>
   try {
      // Code to run
      [break;]
   } 
   catch ( e ) {
      // Code to run if an exception occurs
      [break;]
   }
   [ finally {
      // Code that is always executed regardless of 
      // an exception occurring
   }]
</script>
    ---------------------------------->


    <html>
        <head>
        <script>               
           try {
              var a = 100;
              alert(myFunc(a));                  
           }
           catch (e) {
              alert(e);
           }
           finally {
              alert("Finally block will always execute!" );
           }
        </script>
        </head>
        <body>
           <p>Exception handling using try...catch...finally statements</p>
        </body>
        </html>
<!---------------throw --------------------->

<html>
<head>
<script>
   function myFunc() {
      var a = 100;
      var b = 0;

      try {
         if ( b == 0 ) {
            throw( "Divide by zero error." ); 
         } else {
            var c = a / b;
         }
      }
      catch ( e ) {
         alert("Error: " + e );
      }
   }
</script>      
</head>
<body>
   <p>Click the following to see the result:</p>
   <form>
      <input type = "button" value = "Click Me" onclick = "myFunc();" />
   </form>
</body>
</html>

<!-----------The onerror Event Handler Property
    
    The onerror event handler was the first feature to facilitate error handling in JavaScript. 
    The onerror is an event handler property of the 'window' object, which automatically triggers when any error occurs on any element of the web page.


window.onerror = errorhandler_func;
OR
<ele onerror="errorhandler_func()"> </ele>

 onerror event handler provides three pieces of information
-----------------------------------------------------------
Error message − The same message that the browser would display for the given error

URL − The file in which the error occurred

Line number − The line number in the given URL that caused the error
    ---------------------->

    <html>
        <body>
           <p> Click the following button to see the result:</p>
           <form>
              <input type = "button" value = "Click Me" onclick = "myFunc();" />
           </form>
           <div id = "demo"> </div>
           <script>
              const output = document.getElementById("demo");
              window.onerror = function (msg, url, line) {
                 output.innerHTML = "Error: " + msg + "<br>";
                 output.innerHTML += "URL: " + url + "<br>";
                 output.innerHTML += "Line: " + line + "<br>";
              }
           </script>
