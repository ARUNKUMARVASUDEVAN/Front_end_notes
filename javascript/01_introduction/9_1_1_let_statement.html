<!--
    let statement is used to declare a variable.
    With the let statement, we can declare a variable that is block-scoped. 
-->

<script>
    let name = "John";
    let age = 35;
    let x = true;
</script>


<!--
Block Scope vs. Function Scope

The scope of the variable declared with the let keyword is a block-scope.
It means if you define the variable with the let keyword in the specific block, 
you can access the variable inside that particular block only,
 and if you try to access the variable outside the block, it raises an error like 'variable is not defined'.

function foo(){
   if (true){
      let x = 5
      var y = 10
   }
   
   
   // here x can't be accessed while y is accessible
}
