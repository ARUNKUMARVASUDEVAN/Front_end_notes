<!--
* For the block scope, you should use the let keyword.
* If you need to assign the constant reference to any value, use the const keyword.
* When you require to define the variable inside any particular block, like a loop, 
'if statement', etc. and need to access outside the block but inside the function, you may use the var keyword.
* However, you can use any keyword to define global variables.
* Redeclaring variables is not a good practice. 
  So, you should avoid it, but if necessary, you may use the var keyword.
