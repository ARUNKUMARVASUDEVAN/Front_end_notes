    Advantages of javascript
Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.

Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.

Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.

Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

<!--Imperative vs Declarative
Imperative JavaScript − In imperative JavaScript, we write code in the manner that the code describes the steps to get the output. 
So, we are concerned about the code execution flow and output both

Declarative JavaScript − In declarative JavaScript, we don't need to worry about execution flow,
but we should get the correct output at the end.
