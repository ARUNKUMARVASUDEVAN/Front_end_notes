<!--
* Easy Setup
   We don’t need a particular editor to start writing the JavaScript code

* Browser Support

* Dom mainpulation
 -  It can manipulate webpage contents
* Event Handling 
* Dynamic Typing
 - JavaScript decides the type of variables at runtime. So, we don’t need to care about variable data type while writing the code, providing more flexibility to write code.
* Functional Programming
- It mostly uses the functions as a primary building blocks to solve the problem.

* Cross-platform Support
 - Each operating system and browser support JavaScript. So, it is widely used for developing websites, mobile applications, games, desktop applications, etc

* Object-oriented Programming
 - we can implement all object-oriented programming concepts using its functionality.

* Built-in Objects 
    - JavaScript contains built-in objects like Math and Date. We can use a Math object to perform mathematical operations and a Date object to manipulate the date easily

* Object Prototypes
    - JavaScript, everything is an object. For example, array, function, number, string, boolean, set, map, etc. are objects.
    -  Each object contains the prototype property, which is hidden. You can use the prototype property to achive inheritance or extend the functionality of class or object, by other object’s functionality.
* Global Object
    -JavaScript contains the global object to access the variables which are available everywhere.

* Built-in Methods
    - JavaScript also contains the built-in methods for each object. Developers can use the built-in methods to write efficient and shorter codes.


* Modular Programming
    - JavaScript allows you to write the code in different modules and connect them with the parent module. So developers can write maintainable code.

* JSON
JSON stands for JavaScript object notation. It is a widely used data format to exchange data between two networks. For example, server and client.

* Asynchronous Programming
JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. To execute your code faster, you can use asynchronous programming.

* Server-side Support
The Node.js runtime environment of JavaScript is widely used to create the backend of the application, as javaScript can also be used to create servers.
