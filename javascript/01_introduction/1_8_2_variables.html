<!--
JavaScript variables are used to store data that can be changed later on. These variables can be thought of as named containers.
You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.

<!--4 ways to declare js variable -->

<!--
* Without using any keywords.

* Using the 'var' keyword.

<!--Variable Declaration-->

<script>
    Money = 10;
    Name = "Ether";
 </script>

<script>
    var money;
    var name;
 </script> 

<script>
    var money, name;
 </script>

<script>
    var name = "Ali";
    var money;
    money = 2000.50;
</script>


<script>
    var num = 765; // Number
    var Str = "Welcome"; // String
    var bool = false; // Boolean
    var Bool=false;
   
 </script>


<!--Points to remember 

* In JavaScript, a variable name can contain digits, alphabetical characters,
 and special characters like underscore (_) and dollar sign ($). 
 JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They must begin with a letter or an underscore character.
 For example, 123test is an invalid variable name but _123test is a valid one..

* Variable names are case sensitive.
 It means Name and name are different identifiers.

* The identifiers can also contain the Unicode. 
So, developers may define variables in any language.

* You should not use any of the JavaScript reserved keywords as a variable name.
 For example, break or boolean variable names are not valid.

<!-- Js variable names are also called as Identifiers-->
