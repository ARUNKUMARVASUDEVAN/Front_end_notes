<!--
JavaScript constants are the variables whose values remain unchanged throughout the execution of the program.
You can declare constants using the const keyword.

* A variable defined with const can't be redeclared, reassigned.
* crct way const x = 10;
* Incrct way  const y; y = 20; 
*   const y = 20; 
    y = 40; // This is not possible
* Constant is block scope
* 

-->

<!--Constant array -->
<!--
* We can declare the arrays and objects using the const keyword,
but there is a little twist in the array and object declaration.
* The variable with the const keyword keeps the constant reference but not the constant value. 
* So, you can update the same array or object declared with the const keyword,
 but you can't reassign the reference of the new array or object to the constant variable.
