/*
+ (Addition)	Adds two operands.	x + y will give 30.
- (Subtraction)	Subtracts the second operand from the first.	x - y will give -10.
* (Multiplication)	Multiplies both operands.	x * y will give 200.
/ (Division)	Divides the numerator by the denominator.	y / x will give 2.
% (Modulus)	Outputs the remainder of an integer division.	y % x will give 0
++ (Increment)	Increases an integer value by one.	x++ will give 11.
-- (Decrement)	Decreases an integer value by one.	x-- will give 9.

* Most of the arithmetic operators are binary operators as they perform calculations on two operands.
* Some arithmetic operators are unary operators.The unary operators perform computation on a single operand.
