<!--
while statement  creates a loop that executes a block of code repeatedly, as long as the specified condition is true

* The condition is evaluated before the execution of the block of code.
--------------------------------
There are 2 kinds of while loops|
---------------------------------
Entry-controlled loops − The loop checks whether the looping condition is valid first and enters into the body of the loop to execute the loop statements.

Exit-controlled loops − The loop enters into the body and executes the loop statements without checking the condition. After completing the iteration, it checks the condition.


The purpose of a while loop is to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. Once the expression becomes false, the loop terminates.

Syntax:

while (expression) {
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}

<body>
    <div id = 'output'></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        let output = document.getElementById("output");
        var count = 0;
        output.innerHTML="Starting Loop <br>";
        while (count < 10) {
            output.innerHTML+="Current Count : " + count + "<br>";
            count++;
        }
        output.innerHTML+="Loop stopped!";
    </script>
    <p> Set the variable to a different value and then try... </p>
</body>
</html>


<!--
Do while

do...while loop is similar to the while loop except that the condition check happens at the end of the loop. 
This means that the loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

do {
   Statement(s) to be executed;
} while (expression);
