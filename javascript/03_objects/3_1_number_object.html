<!--

 JavaScript Number object represents numerical data as floating-point numbers. 
 It contains different properties (constants) and methods for working on numbers. In general, you do not need to worry about Number objects because the browser automatically converts number literals to instances of the number class.

 Other types of data such as strings, etc., can be converted to numbers using Number() function

 JavaScript does not make a distinction between integer values and floating-point values. JavaScript

Syntax:

const val = new Number(number);

let num1 = 24;
let num2 = 35.65;

<!--
Properties

EPSILON

It represents the difference between 1 and the smallest floating point number greater than 1.

	
MAX_SAFE_INTEGER

It returns the maximum safe integer value.


MAX_VALUE

The largest possible value a number in JavaScript can have 1.7976931348623157E+308.

	
MIN_SAFE_INTEGER

It returns the minimum safe integer value.

	
MIN_VALUE

The smallest possible value a number in JavaScript can have 5E-324.

	
NaN

Equal to a value that is not a number.

	
NEGATIVE_INFINITY

A value that is less than MIN_VALUE.

	
POSITIVE_INFINITY

A value that is greater than MAX_VALUE

	
prototype

A static property of the Number object. Use the prototype property to assign new properties and methods to the Number object in the current document.

	
constructor

Returns the function that created this object's instance. By default this is the Number object.
