<!--

*   JavaScript object is a non-primitive data type that is used to store data as key-value pairs. 
*   The key-value pairs are often referred as properties.
*   A key in a key-value pair, also called a "property name", is a string and value can be anything. 
*   If a property's value is a function, the property is known as a method.


JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language:

Encapsulation − the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.

Abstraction − the capability to hide object's implementation details from users.

Inheritance − the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.

Polymorphism − the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.


**Object Properties**

Object properties can be any of the primitive data types, objects or functions. Object properties are usually variables that are used internally in the object's methods, but can also be globally visible variables that are used throughout the page.

objectName.objectProperty = propertyValue;

var str = document.title; -- this gives document title

<!--Object Methods-->
document.write("This is test");

<!--Creating New object

<!--JavaScript Object Literal

const obj = {
   key: val,
}
-->
<html>
<body>
   <p id = "output"> </p>
   <script>
      const myBook = {
         title: "Perl",
         author: "Mohtashim",
         pages: 355,
      }
      document.getElementById("output").innerHTML =
      "Book name is : " + myBook.title + "<br>"
      +"Book author is : " + myBook.author + "<br>"
      +"Total pages : " + myBook.pages;
   </script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- new Operator-->
<!--
The new operator is used to create an instance of an object. 
To create an object, the new operator is followed by the constructor method.
-->

<html>
<body>  
   <p id = "output"> </p>
   <script>
      var book = new Object();   // Create the object
      book.subject = "Perl";     // Assign properties to the object
      book.author  = "Mohtashim";
      document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = 
      "Book name is : " + book.subject + "<br>" + 
      "Book author is : " + book.author;
   </script>   
</body>
</html>

<!--Constructor Function

// Object template
function ConstructorFunc(para) {
    this.para = para;
}
const obj = new ConstructorFunc(arg);
-->
<html>
<body>   
   <div id = "output"> </div>
   <script>
      function Book(title, author) {
         this.title = title; 
         this.author  = author;
      }
      const myBooks = new Book("Perl", "Mohtashim");
      document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = 
      "Book title is : " + myBooks.title + "<br>" +
      "Book author is : " + myBooks.author + "<br>";
   </script>      
</body>
</html>

<!--Object.create()
Object.create() method creates a new object from the already defined object.

const obj = Object.create({}, {
    key: { value: val },
})

{} − It is an empty object. The Object.create() method creates a copy of it.

{ key: { value: val }, } − It is an object containing the properties to add to the prototype of the cloned object.

<body>
   <p id = "output"> </p>
   <script>
      const myBookz = Object.create({}, {
         title: { value: "Perl" },
         author: { value: "Mohtashim" },
      })
        
      document.getElementById("output").innerHTML =
