<!--
JavaScript object is a non-primitive data type that is used to store data as key-value pairs. 
The key-value pairs are often referred as properties.
 A key in a key-value pair, also called a "property name", is a string and value can be anything.
 If a property's value is a function, the property is known as a method.

*   Encapsulation − the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.

*   Abstraction − the capability to hide object's implementation details from users.

*   Inheritance − the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.

*   Polymorphism − the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.
