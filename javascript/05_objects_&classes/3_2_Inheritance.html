<!--
inheritance in JavaScript allows the child class to inherit the properties and methods of the parent class.

Parent class − It is a class whose properties are inherited by other classes.

Child class − It is a class that inherits the properties of the other class.


-------------------
Single class Inheritance:

You can use the 'extends' keyword to inherit the parent class properties into the child class.

class childClass extends parentClass {
    // Child class body
}

<html>
<body>
   <div id = "output1">The brand of the bike is: </div>
   <div id = "output2">Total gears in the bike is: </div>
   <script>
      // Parent class
      class Bike {
         constructor() {
            this.gear = 5;
         }

         getGears() {
            return this.gear;
         }
      }
      // Child class
      class suzuki extends Bike {
         constructor() {
            super();
            this.brand = "Yamaha"
         }

         getBrand() {
            return this.brand;
         }
      }

      const suzukiBike = new suzuki();
      document.getElementById("output1").innerHTML += suzukiBike.getBrand();
      document.getElementById("output2").innerHTML += suzukiBike.getGears();
   </script>
</body>
</html>

<!--how to initialize the properties of the parent class from the child class

     super() 
The super() keyword is used to invoke the method or access the properties of the parent class in the child class.
By default, the super() keyword invokes the constructor function of the parent class.
You can also pass the parameters to the super() keyword to pass it to the constructor of the parent class.
-->

<html>
<body>
   <div id = "output1">The brand of the bike is: </div>
   <div id = "output2">Total gears in the bike is: </div>
   <script>
      // Parent class
      class Bike {
         constructor(gears) {
            this.gears = gears;
        }
      }
      // Child class
      class suzuki extends Bike {
         constructor(brand, gears) {
            super(gears);
            this.brand = brand;
         }
      }
      const suzukiBikes = new suzuki("Suzuki", 4);
      document.getElementById("output1").innerHTML += suzukiBikes.brand;
      document.getElementById("output2").innerHTML += suzukiBikes.gears;

   </script>
</body>
</html>


<!--Multilevel Inheritance-->
<!--
Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in JavaScript.
In multilevel inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another class, and other classes inherit current class properties

class A {
}
class B extends A {
}
class C extends B {
}
-->

<html>
<body>
   <p id = "output"> </p>
   <script>
      // Parent class
      class Bike {
         constructor(gears) {
            this.gears = gears;
         }
      }
      // Child class
      class Honda extends Bike {
         constructor(brand, gears) {
            super(gears);
            this.brand = brand;
         }
      }
      class Shine extends Honda {
         constructor(model, brand, gears) {
            super(brand, gears);
            this.model = model;
         }
      }
      const newBike = new Shine("Shine", "Honda", 5);
      document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = `The ${newBike.model} model of the ${newBike.brand} brand has total ${newBike.gears} gears.`;
   </script>


<!--Hierarchial Inheritance-->
<!--
Syntax

class A {
}
class B extends A {
}
Class C extends A {
}

JavaScript hierarchical inheritance, one class is inherited by multiple classes.
-->

<html>
<body>
   <p id = "output1"> Honda Bike Object: </p>
   <p id = "output2"> Suzuki Bike Object: </p>
   <script>
      // Parent class
      class Bike {
         constructor(gears) {
            this.gears = gears;
         }
      }
      // Child class
      class Honda extends Bike {
         constructor(model, gears) {
            super(gears);
            this.model = model;
         }
      }
      // Child class
      class Suzuki extends Bike {
         constructor(model, color, gears) {
            super(gears);
            this.model = model;
            this.color = color;
         }
      }
      const h_Bike = new Honda("Shine", 5);
      const s_Bike = new Suzuki("Zx6", "Blue", 6);
      document.getElementById("output1").innerHTML += JSON.stringify(h_Bike);
      document.getElementById("output2").innerHTML += JSON.stringify(s_Bike);
   </script>
</body>
</html>


<!--Inheriting Static Members of the Class-->
<!--
you can invoke the static methods of the parent class using the super keyword in the child class. 
Outside the child class, you can use the child class name to invoke the static methods of the parent and child class.

-->

<html>
<body>
   <p id = "output">The bike name is: </p>
   <script>
      // Parent class
      class Bike {
         constructor(gears) {
            this.gears = gears;
         }

         static getDefaultBrand() {
            return "Yamaha";
         }
      }
      // Child class
      class Honda extends Bike {
         constructor(model, gears) {
            super(gears);
            this.model = model;
         }
         static BikeName() {
            return super.getDefaultBrand() + ", X6";
         }
      }
      document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += Honda.BikeName();
   </script>
</body>
</html>
