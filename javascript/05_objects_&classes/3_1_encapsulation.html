What is Encapsulation

Encapsulation in JavaScript is a way to keep the related properties and methods under a single namespace by bundling them.
It can be a function, a class or an object. In JavaScript, the encapsulation can be implemented using closures, classes and getters and setters.
It is used to hide the data from the outside world and give access to required data only to improve the integrity and security of the data.


What is the need for encapsulation:
------------------------------------

const car = {
   Brand: "Honda city",
   model: "sx",
   year: 2016,
}

can access the properties of the car object, as shown below
* car.Brand

anyone can change the value of any property of the car object, as shown below.
* car.Brand=true;


Different Ways to Achieve Encapsulation in JavaScript:

*   Using the function closures

*   Using the ES6 classes

*   Using the Getters and Setters

<!--Achieving Encapsulation Using the Function Closures-->

<!--
A JavaScript function closure is a concept allowing the inner function to access the variable defined in the outer function even after the outer function is executed. 
The variables defined in the outer function can't be accessed outside its functional scope but can be accessed using the inner scope.

Example:|
---------
In the below code, shoppingCart() function is an outer function that contains the variables and function. The outer function has its private scope.

The carItems[] array is used to store the shopping cart's items.

The add() function can access the carItems[] array and add items.

The remove() function checks whether the cartItems[] contains the items you need to remove. If yes, it removes the item. Otherwise, it prints the message that you can't remove the item.

The shoppingCart() function returns the object containing the add() and remove() functions.

After creating a new instance of the shoppingCart() function, you can use the add() and remove() functions to manipulate the shopping cart data.

<html>
<body>
  <p id = "output"> </p>
  <script>
    let output = document.getElementById("output");
    function shoppingCart() {
      const cartItems = [];
      function add(item) {
        cartItems.push(item);
        output.innerHTML += `${item.name} added to the cart. <br>`;
      }
      function remove(itemName) {
        const index = cartItems.findIndex(item => item.name === itemName);
        if (index !== -1) {
          const removedItem = cartItems.splice(index, 1)[0];
          output.innerHTML += `${removedItem.name} removed from the cart. <br>`;
        } else {
          output.innerHTML += `Item ${itemName} not found in the cart. <br>`;
        }
      }
      return {
        add,
        remove,
      };
    }

    // Defining items
    const item1 = { name: 'Car', price: 1000000 };
    const item2 = { name: 'Bike', price: 100000 };
    // Create a new Shopping cart
    const cart = shoppingCart();
    // Adding items to the cart
    cart.add(item1);
    cart.add(item2);
    // Remove bike from the cart
    cart.remove('Bike');
  </script>
</body>

Bank Account Management System:
Create a bankAccount function that manages a balance. Implement methods to deposit money, withdraw money, and check the balance. Ensure the balance can only be modified through these methods.

Library Book Management:
Design a library function that manages a collection of books. Implement methods to add a book, remove a book, and view all books. Ensure that the book collection is only accessible through these methods.

Student Grade System:
Create a gradeSystem function to manage student grades. Implement methods to add a grade, remove a grade, and calculate the average grade. Keep the grades private and only accessible through these methods.

Movie Collection Manager:
Write a movieCollection function that manages a collection of movies. Include methods to add a movie, remove a movie, and list all movies. Ensure that the movies are only accessible and modifiable through these methods.

Task Manager:
Develop a taskManager function that handles a list of tasks. Implement methods to add a task, mark a task as completed, and list all tasks with their statuses. Keep the task list private and only manipulable via the provided methods.

<!--Achieving Encapsulation Using ES6 Classes and Private Variables-->

<!--
Private Variables (Fields) in JavaScript
To define the private class variables, you can write a variable name followed by the ‘#’ sign.

class car {
    #name= "TATA";
}

-->

<html>
<body>
  <div id = "output1">The car mileage is:  </div>
  <div id = "output2">After updating the car mileage is:  </div>
  <script>
    class Car {
      #brand = "TATA"; // Private field
      #name = "Nexon"; // Private field
      #milage = 16;    // Private field

      getMilage() {
        return this.#milage; // Accessing private field
      }

    setMilage(milage) {
      this.#milage = milage; // Modifying private field
    }
    }

    let carobj = new Car();
    document.getElementById("output1").innerHTML += carobj.getMilage();
    carobj.setMilage(20);
    document.getElementById("output2").innerHTML += carobj.getMilage();
    // carobj.#milage);  will throw an error.
  </script>
