         but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. <img class="tutimg2" src="images/tutimg.png" />Lorem Ipsum is simply
         dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
         unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
         five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
         popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
         with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. It is a long
         established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
