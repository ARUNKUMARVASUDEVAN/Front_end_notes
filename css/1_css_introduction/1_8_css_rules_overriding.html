<!--
Any inline style sheet takes highest priority. So, it will override any rule defined in <style>...</style> tags or rules defined in any external style sheet file.

Any rule defined in <style>...</style> tags will override rules defined in any external style sheet file.

Any rule defined in external style sheet file takes lowest priority, and rules defined in this file will be applied only when above two rules are not applicable
