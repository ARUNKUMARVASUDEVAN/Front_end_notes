<!--
Pseudo-classes often used along with CSS Selectors by inserting a colon (:) after selector. For example a : hover{}, Here selector `a` will selects all the anchor tags in document.

A functional pseudo-class contains a pair of parentheses to define the arguments. For example: :lang(en).

The element to which a pseudo-class is attached, is termed as an anchor element. For example: button:hover, a:focus, etc. Here button and a elements are called the anchor elements.

Pseudo-classes apply style to an element as per the content of the document tree.

Pseudo-classes also apply a style to an element in relation to the external factors, such as history of the navigation of the element (:visited), status of the content (:checked), or position of mouse (:hover)
